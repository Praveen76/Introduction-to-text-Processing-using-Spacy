## Introduction

Text processing is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) that involves analyzing and manipulating text data. In this project, we provide an introduction to text processing using the spaCy library. We utilize the Medical NER dataset to demonstrate various text processing techniques.

---

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the experiment, you will be able to:

- Understand the spaCy library
- Perform simple natural language processing tasks using the spaCy library

---

## Features and Capabilities

spaCy's features and capabilities include:

- **Tokenization**: Segmenting text into words, punctuation marks, etc.
- **Part-of-speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning word types to tokens, like verb or noun.
- **Dependency Parsing**: Assigning syntactic dependency labels, describing the relations between individual tokens, like subject or object.
- **Lemmatization**: Assigning the base forms of words. For example, the lemma of “was” is “be”, and the lemma of “rats” is “rat”.
- **Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD)**: Finding and segmenting individual sentences.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Labeling named “real-world” objects, like persons, companies, or locations.
- **Entity Linking (EL)**: Disambiguating textual entities to unique identifiers in a knowledge base.
- **Similarity**: Comparing words, text spans, and documents and how similar they are to each other.
- **Text Classification**: Assigning categories or labels to a whole document or parts of a document.
- **Rule-based Matching**: Finding sequences of tokens based on their texts and linguistic annotations, similar to regular expressions.
- **Training**: Updating and improving a statistical model's predictions.
- **Serialization**: Saving objects to files or byte strings.

## Usage

### Running the Notebook Locally

To run the notebook locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-text-Processing-using-Spacy.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

    ```
    cd Introduction-to-text-Processing-using-Spacy
    ```

3. Open the notebook file `Introduction-to-text-Processing-using-Spacy.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Execute the notebook cells one by one to understand the spaCy library and perform text processing tasks.
